# VulnWebLab  
**Intentionally Vulnerable Web Application for Cybersecurity Education**

## Overview

VulnWebLab is an intentionally vulnerable web application developed to support
**hands-on learning, teaching, and research** in web application security.

The project provides a controlled environment where students can:
- Study common web vulnerabilities
- Practice exploitation techniques in a legal and ethical setting
- Understand how attacks translate into real-world security risks
- Learn corresponding defensive and mitigation strategies

VulnWebLab is inspired by classical vulnerable applications (e.g., bWAPP), but is designed with a **more academic, modular, and extensible structure** to support modern cybersecurity curricula.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended **strictly for educational and research purposes**.

- Do NOT deploy this application on public or production systems
- Do NOT use the techniques learned here against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test

The authors are **not responsible for misuse** of this material.
